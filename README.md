Introduction to system: 

 The Nursery Management System has been designed to override the problem of existing manual system. This web application is supported to eliminate and in some case reduce the hardship faced by manual system. The application is reduced as much as possible to avoid errors while entering the data. Itâ€™s also provide message while entering invalid data. No formal knowledge is required for the user to operate this system. Overall we said that Nursery Management System is user friendly. 
In Nursery Management System we use PHP and MySQL Database. This project keeps the records of orders, clients and products (Plants, Flower and Seeds). Nursery Management System has two module i.e. admin and user.

Proposed system:

The proposed system is computerized and has been developed using advance language therefore it gives more facilities than present system. It provides quick access to any data. In this system user have to enter the data only once and then it get linked with all files. This reduces the workload of user and it is also a time saving process. The information about any Subscriber can be easily retrieved. The system maintains all records easy.

3. It helps nursery staff to serve their value customer in minimal delay.
4. The system can be implemented with low cost and is affordable for most of the small medium enterprise nursery, because the hardware requirements are not required to be high end powerful in order to support the system.
