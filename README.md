 The Nursery Management System has been designed to override the problem of existing manual system. This web application is supported to eliminate and in some case reduce the hardship faced by manual system. The application is reduced as much as possible to avoid errors while entering the data. Itâ€™s also provide message while entering invalid data. No formal knowledge is required for the user to operate this system. Overall we said that Nursery Management System is user friendly.
